# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the project is pre-1.0 (`0.x`), minor releases may contain breaking changes.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Per-path named AWS profile support in `make_s3_upath`. Combinable with a custom
  `endpoint_url`, mutually exclusive with `anon=True` and explicit
  `key`/`secret`/`token`. Setting a profile takes environment credentials out of
  boto's resolution chain, so the path signs with the profile's keys only.

### Changed

- Renamed the package to `freezebase`, to allow publication on
  PyPI under the same name. The import path, PyPI distribution name,
  `FREEZEBASE_CACHE`/`FREEZEBASE_DATA` environment variables, and the GitHub
  repository all changed accordingly; there is no compatibility shim for the old names.
- `make_s3_upath` rejects credentials in `client_kwargs`, which reach s3fs but
  not `s3_env`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Explicit `anon` argument on `make_s3_upath`, matching the `anon` parameter of
  `s3fs.S3FileSystem`: `anon=True` uses an anonymous connection (public buckets
  only); `anon=False` (the default) uses the `key`/`secret` given, or boto's
  credential resolver. Combining `anon=True` with `key`, `secret`, or `token`
  raises `ValueError`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** anonymous S3 access is now opt-in.

  ```python
  # before
  path = make_s3_upath("s3://copernicus-dem-30m/x.tif", region="eu-central-1")
  # after
  path = make_s3_upath("s3://copernicus-dem-30m/x.tif", region="eu-central-1", anon=True)

### Fixed

- `make_s3_upath` (for s3fs) and `s3_env` (for GDAL) now agree on the
anonymous/signed decision. Previously, without passing credentials, GDAL read
unsigned while s3fs signed via boto's resolver.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- `py.typed` marker so downstream type checkers use the inline annotations.
- Optional `DatasetMetadata.sha256` to verify a raw download against a known
  hash (`freezebase.vectordata`).
- `freezebase.utils.file_sha256` helper.
- Packaging metadata: project URLs, keywords, and classifiers.
- GitHub Actions CI (lint, type-check, test matrix on 3.12/3.13, a
  lowest-bound dependency job, a MinIO-backed S3 integration job, and a build +
  wheel smoke-test) and a Trusted-Publishing release workflow.
- S3 integration tests (`tests/test_s3_integration.py`, `integration` marker),
  skipped unless `FREEZEBASE_TEST_S3_*` is set.
- `freezebase.s3.s3_env`, a rasterio context manager that configures
  credentials and endpoint for S3-compatible object storage from a `UPath`'s
  storage options. Usable with `rasterio` or `rioxarray`.
- `rewrite_tiff` can now copy between two different S3 backends (e.g. an
  unsigned public bucket to a private one); the source read and destination
  write each apply their own credentials, so the previous same-backend
  restriction is gone.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `make_s3_upath` renamed its first parameter `root` → `path` and
  gained optional `token` and `region`; `key`/`secret` are now optional so it
  can build paths for anonymous (unsigned) access to public buckets.
- S3 rasterio setup consolidated into `freezebase.s3` and is now rasterio-only:
  the optional GDAL helper were removed
- Dependency lower bounds corrected to the oldest versions that actually
  install and work on Python 3.12: notably `numpy>=2.0` (code uses `np.concat`),
  `shapely>=2.1.0` (`transform(interleaved=...)`), `pyarrow>=17.0` (NumPy 2 ABI),
  `pyproj>=3.6.1`, `boto3>=1.36`, and `s3fs>=2026.2.0`/`fsspec>=2026.2.0`
  (`set_custom_error_handler`).
- Licensing metadata modernized to PEP 639 (`license = "MIT"` +
  `license-files`), and the sdist no longer ships `.python-version`/`uv.lock`.
- **Breaking:** `GeoVectorData.remove()` is renamed to `cleanup()` and now
  defaults to removing only the raw download (`raw=True, processed=False`),
  keeping the processed data.
- **Breaking:** `rewrite_tiff()` no longer deletes the source by default; pass
  `move=True` for the previous move semantics.
- `HTTPDownloader.__call__` gained an `overwrite` keyword (default `False`) and
  now rejects unsafe/inferred filenames that would escape the destination.
- S3 transient-retry codes narrowed so a permanent `AccessDenied`/403 is no
  longer retried.
- `COG_PROFILE` now sets `OVERVIEW_RESAMPLING=AVERAGE` (GDAL defaults to
  `CUBIC`, which propagates NODATA into overview pyramids) and
  `PREDICTOR=YES`/`PREDICTOR_OVERVIEW=YES`, which shrinks float32 rasters by
  ~10-15% at unchanged write cost.

### Fixed

- Filename confinement and redirect credential handling in the downloader.
- Destination/source preservation on failure in `rewrite_tiff`.
- Numerous MGRS/UTM/CRS validation and parsing defects.
- VRT/merge input validation and XML-safe VRT generation.
- Z-coordinate detection across polygon interior rings and mixed collections.
- Atomic cache writes and verification-state reset on removal.
