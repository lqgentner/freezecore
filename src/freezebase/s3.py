"""Shared S3 UPath construction, retry configuration, and rasterio env.

Single source of truth for building S3-backed `UPath` instances, for which
S3/botocore errors are transient and how many times to retry them, and for the
GDAL/rasterio environment used to read and write rasters on S3-compatible
object storage. Build every S3 path via :func:`make_s3_upath` rather than
constructing a bare `UPath` directly, and wrap raster I/O in :func:`s3_env`.

Importing this module registers a `s3fs.core.set_custom_error_handler` callback,
which is what gates `ClientError` retries inside s3fs's own retry loop -- separate
from (and consulted after) botocore's `retries.max_attempts` config.

    :func:`freezebase.raster` enters on *every* raster operation.

    Caching is safe for rotating credentials: rasterio re-freezes the session's
    credentials on each `rasterio.Env` entry, so refreshable STS/SSO profiles
    still pick up new keys on their own. Static credentials read from a file are

        A UPath with ``protocol="s3"`` whose ``storage_options`` carry an

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        S3 URI or prefix, e.g. ``"s3://my-bucket/some/key.tif"``. The ``s3``
        protocol is forced, so a bare ``"my-bucket/key"`` also works.
    anon : bool, default False
        Whether to use an anonymous connection (public buckets only). If
        ``False``, uses ``profile``, the ``key``/``secret`` given, or boto's
        default credential resolver. Mirrors ``s3fs.S3FileSystem``'s ``anon``.
    profile : str, optional
        Named AWS configuration profile to use for this path. The profile name
        is stored on the path and used independently by both s3fs and Rasterio.
        May be combined with ``endpoint_url`` for S3-compatible stores, but not
        with ``anon=True`` or explicit ``key``, ``secret``, or ``token``.
        Setting a profile explicitly makes boto skip its environment-variable
        credential provider on both layers, so such a path can never be signed
        by ambient ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``/``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` values --
        which is what makes profiles the safer way to authenticate here.
    key : str, optional
        If not anonymous, use this access key ID, if specified. Mutually
        exclusive with ``aws_access_key_id`` in ``client_kwargs``.
    secret : str, optional
        If not anonymous, use this secret access key, if specified. Mutually
        exclusive with ``aws_secret_access_key`` in ``client_kwargs``.
    token : str, optional
        If not anonymous, use this security token, if specified, for
        temporary/STS credentials.
    region : str, optional
        AWS region name. Relevant for region-scoped AWS-native buckets.
    endpoint_url : str, optional
        S3-compatible endpoint URL. Omit for AWS-native S3.
    request_checksum_calculation, response_checksum_validation : str, default "when_required"
        boto3 >=1.36 checksum behavior. ``"when_required"`` avoids the
        ``x-amz-checksum-*`` trailers that some S3-compatible gateways (e.g.
        Ceph) reject; it's a safe default even for gateways not known to need it.
    client_kwargs : dict, optional
        Extra kwargs forwarded to the underlying botocore client. Defaults to
        ``{"endpoint_url": endpoint_url}``. ``region`` is injected here as
        ``region_name``. Credentials passed here (:data:`CLIENT_CREDENTIAL_KEYS`)
        reach s3fs only, never :func:`s3_env`, so they are rejected alongside
        ``anon=True`` and ``profile`` rather than silently signing the two
        layers differently.

    Returns
    -------
    UPath
        An S3 `UPath` configured with :data:`S3_MAX_ATTEMPTS` botocore retries in
        :data:`S3_RETRY_MODE` mode, on top of the s3fs-level retry handler
        registered by this module. Pair it with :func:`s3_env` for raster I/O.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``anon=True`` is combined with a profile or credentials, if a profile
        is combined with explicit ``key``, ``secret``, ``token``, or credentials
        in ``client_kwargs``, or if ``profile`` is an empty string.
